\section*{About us}

We at CSS are one of the largest departmental societies at the University of Birmingham. With over 260 members this last year, we have access to a large, talented member base who are passionate about tech and engaged with the local tech community.

\vspace{1cm}

We pride ourselves on our strong industry links, from our connections to local hackathons, to our involvement with Silicon Canal and the BCS (British Computer Society), and finally with companies like you.
With these links, we're able to provide our members with fantastic access to tech talks, career advice sessions, careers fairs, and much more to prepare them for the world outside of university.
We also provide a wide range of regular social events for students, such as movie nights, quizzes, LAN parties, and of course, our annual CSS ball and summer BBQ.

\vspace{1cm}

This year, with your help, we're aiming to expand our links with industry, foster better relationships with nearby universities and the local tech community, and run regular tech workshops with the help of our sponsors and partners and continue to ensure that our members have the best university experience possible.

\section*{Sponsorship benefits}

Why should your company be interested in becoming a sponsor?
We have many benefits available, with our main ones listed overleaf.

\newpage

\subsection*{Excellent student engagement rates}

In 2018-2019, we reached a new record total of 260 members, a massive achievement. As one of our end goals for this year, we plan to raise even more awareness of the opportunities offered by the society and continue to grow.
Additionally, we've attracted much more interest in running for committee positions, giving us one of our largest committees ever this year.
Furthermore, the attendance rate of our events has grown over the years, as we started to target all available social media channels and make use of our strong bond with the School board. 
Our annual CSS ball had more than 120 members attending, while our CSS BBQ reached a turnout of 80 members.

\subsection*{Showcase cutting-edge technology}

Technology makes up the core of what we at CSS are interested in, and we are always interested in doing more!
You will have the chance to demonstrate any technologies that your company uses by sponsoring tech talks, hackathons or any other kind of event.
This means that you can engage with the UoB tech community in a fun and creative way, while showcasing the tech capabilities of your company.

\subsection*{Opportunity to recruit top individuals}

UoB’s School of Computer Science is one of the top 15 departments in the UK. We are home to a number of award-winning societies such as ourselves, as well as the Hacking Society, which is currently ranked as the 2nd top academic team in the UK.
This means our members are amongst the brightest STEM students in the country - as a CSS sponsor, you will thus have the opportunity of promoting company recruitment schemes to highly skilled individuals.
Previously, numerous students have applied and successfully gained positions in summer programmes and/or graduate schemes run by companies who have engaged with them throughout the year. 

\subsection*{Promote your company to a diverse group of students}

Diversity is key in any company that wants to keep a competitive edge in the tech industry. As a society, CSS massively encourages this initiative - our efforts include adding a Diversity Representative position as part of our committee and engaging more with the wider EPS community to encourage a better approach to diversity in STEM in general.
Furthermore, our members form a truly diverse group - from several nationalities (Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Romanian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian and many more) to four different year groups.

\subsection*{Most importantly… sponsor an award-winning society!}

Our hard work has been recognised through distinguished EPS awards for several years, thus rewarding our commitment and passion for offering CSS members a unique university experience. 
You will be sponsoring a society that has ultimately brought the feeling of ‘belonging to a family’ in the Computer Science department.
A society that actively works towards improving and growing each year through diversifying events and bringing in opportunities that benefit both our members and the local tech community.
