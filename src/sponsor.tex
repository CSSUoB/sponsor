\section*{About us}

CSS (Computer Science Society) is one of the largest departmental societies at the University of Birmingham.
We provide a wide range of regular social events  for Computer Science students, such as movie nights, quizzes, LAN parties, annual CSS ball and summer BBQ.
Additionally, we use our strong links established within the tech community to prepare our members for the world outside university.
Our goal is to enhance employability of our members by organising relevant tech talks, hackathons, career advice sessions and various employer-led events.

\section*{Sponsorship benefits}

Why should your company sponsor our society?
Even though there are numerous benefits gained from this partnership, we have summarised the top 5 in the list below.

\subsection*{5. Great student engagement rates}

CSS is one of the largest departmental societies in the Engineering and Physical Sciences (EPS) college. In 2018-2019, we reached a new record total of 260 members. As one of our end goals for this year, we plan to raise even more awareness of the opportunities offered by the society.
Furthermore, the attendance rate of our events has grown over the years, as we started to target all available social media channels and make use of our strong bond with the School board. 
The annual CSS ball had more than 120 members attending, while our CSS BBQ reached a turnout of 80 members.

\subsection*{4. Showcase cutting-edge technology}

You will have the chance to demonstrate any technologies that your company uses by sponsoring tech talks, hackathons or other type of competitions. Additionally, the CSS hardware lab can be used throughout the events! 
This means that you can engage with the UoB tech community in a fun and creative way, while showcasing tech capabilities of the company.

\subsection*{3. Opportunity to recruit top individuals}

UoB’s School of Computer Science is one of the top 15 departments in the UK. We are home to a number of award-winning societies such as ourselves, as well as the Hacking Society, which is currently ranked as the 2nd top academic team in the UK.
This means our members are amongst the brightest STEM students in the country - as a CSS sponsor, you will thus have the opportunity of promoting company recruitment schemes to highly skilled individuals.
Previously, numerous students have applied and successfully gained positions in summer programmes or graduate schemes run by companies who have engaged with them throughout the year. 

\subsection*{2. Promote your company to a diverse group of students}

Diversity is key in any company that wants to keep a competitive edge in the tech industry. As a society, CSS massively encourages this initiative - our efforts include adding a Diversity Representative position as part of our committee in 2016. 
Furthermore, our members form a truly diverse group - from several nationalities (Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Romanian, Bulgarian, Lithuanian and many more) to four different year groups and reaching over 40 female members out of a total of 224 last year! 

\subsection*{1. Most importantly… sponsor an award-winning society!}

Our hard work has been recognised through distinguished EPS awards for several years, thus rewarding our commitment and passion for offering CSS members a unique university experience. 
You will be sponsoring a society that has ultimately brought the feeling of ‘belonging to a family’ in the Computer Science department.
A society that actively works towards improving and growing each year through diversifying events and bringing in opportunities that benefit both our members and the local tech community.
